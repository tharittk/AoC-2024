Day 6: Guard Patroling
Part 1: simple while loop until out-of-bound position detected. Refactoring turning logic helps code clean
Part 2: keeps track every obstacle on which side it has been hit. If the same side was hit twice, the loop is detected.
Day 7: Operator Serach
Part 1: Recursion for O(2^n) with optimization via early termination, which was possible because + and * only increase the value
Part 2: From O(2^n) to O(3^n). The same optimization is applied as concatenation has the same nature as + and *
